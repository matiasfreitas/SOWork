Hello! My name's Gordon Wilson. I
come from Aberdeen in Scotland, but
now I live and work in London. I have a
small flat near the centre. I'm a waiter and
I'm also a drama student. I work in an
Italian restaurant. I eat Italian food and I
drink Italian and French wine. I don't
drink beer. I don't like it. And I don't play
sports. I speak three languages - English,
French, and a little Italian. I want to be an
actor.
